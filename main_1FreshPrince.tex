Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In South LA born and raised
On the beach was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, "Yajin is a super fan of otter!!!!!!!!r"
Another one said, "Yeah, I think so!"

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Spotify on and said, "I might as well kick it"

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking oat milk from a compostable cup
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright

But wait, I hear they're into UMAP and tSNE, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
To the place where people ball free?
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
The derivative of 2x is 2

Well, the plane landed after 3 hours and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air"

Ok I pull up, hop out at the after party at about seven or eight
And I yelled to the Uber driver, "Yo holmes, smell ya later"
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
